# Zerodha Kite API Implementation using python
I have tried some sample programs to capture tick data using Zerodha Kite API. Please validate and use at your own risk.

1.Kite_TickToCandle - Converts the ticks stored (generated by the Kite_getTicks script) in the ticks table to 1 min candles<br>
2.Kite_getTicks - Gets daily tick data and store in sqlite database<br>
3.getAccess_token.py - (Discontinued) Gets access token from the kite url https://kite.trade/connect/login?v=3&api_key=  
4.GetInstrumentsDaily - Gets daily NSE instruments data through Zerodha Kite API<br>
5.kite_options_sell.py - Option Selling program based on Mean Reversion approach (wip)
